                        The <b>Romans</b> founded <i>London</i> about 50 AD. Its name is derived from the Celtic word Londinios, which means the place of the bold one. After they invaded Britain in 43 AD the Romans built a bridge across the Thames. They later decided it was an excellent place to build a port. The water was deep enough for ocean going ships but it was far enough inland to be safe from Germanic raiders. Around 50 AD Roman merchants built a town by the bridge. So London was born.
        
                        The early settlement at London did not have stone walls but there may have been a ditch and an earth rampart with a wooden palisade on top.
                        
                        Then in 61 AD Queen Boudicca led a rebellion against the Romans. Her army marched on London. No attempt was made to defend London. Boudicca burned London but after her rebellion was crushed it was rebuilt. Rich people built houses of stone or brick with tiled roofs but most people lived in wooden houses.
                        
                        By the end of the 2nd century a stone wall was erected around London. The wall was 20 feet high. Outside the wall was a ditch. In the middle of the 3rd century 20 bastions were added to the walls (a bastion was a semi-circular tower projecting from the wall).
                        
                        The population of Roman London rose to perhaps 45,000, which seems small to us but it was the largest town in Britain.

                        In the center of <b>Roman London</b> was the forum. This was a square with shops and <q>public buildings</q> arranged around it. The most important building in the forum was the basilica or 'town hallâ€™, which was 500 feet long and 70 feet high. In Roman London there were brick works, potteries and glass works. There were also donkey powered mills for grinding grain to flour and bakeries.
                        
                        Roman London was also an important port with wooden wharves and jetties. Grain and metal were exported and luxury goods were imported. (Things like wine, olive oil, glass, fine pottery, silk and ivory).
                        
                        Rich citizens had baths in their homes but there were several public baths near the city gates. (Romans went to the baths to socialize not just to keep clean). Most people in the town got their water from wells and used cesspools but there were underground drains to remove rainwater.
                        
                        Roman London also had an amphitheater, which could hold 8,000 people. Here gladiators fought to the death. Cockfighting was also a popular sport.
